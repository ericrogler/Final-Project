0,10/10,Flight from QATAR to MEDINAH was very great…………..the only thing was that while going to Medinah there was no IFE.
1,10/10,"Flew Economy NZ to Dublin through Doha. Asked at Doha airport for an upgrade on return flight and got it. In respect to ground/cabin crew first class treatment at all times. Liquids/food seemed to flow endlessly on this longest haul flights, the food was all yummy. In flight entertainment was awesome I was able to watch all of the Big, Little Eyes series. My partner and I requested emergency exit seats on all flights, we secured these and were not charged extra. We paid for access to business lounge at Doha and had an awesome shower. Highly recommend this airline and will fly with them again next year."
2,1/10,"Our flight from Sydney to Madrid was delayed by 9 hours. We were not informed until we arrived to check in. Stood in line for 3 hours only to be turned away. No explanation or apology. Just a complete absence of any communication. Returned 9 hours later at 3:30am, stood in check-in line for another 2 hours. Had to spend $480 on taxi fares. Arrived in Doha, delay meant we missed our connecting flight so we had to spend a day in Qatar. Waited in line for another hour while accommodation was arranged (couldn’t this have been done while we were in the air? Didn’t they know this would need to be organised?) Qatar put us up in the Best Western. This hotel at $60AUD per night is nightmarish slum. Told by guards not to leave the hotel. Finally arrive in Madrid 52 hours after leaving Sydney. I wanted my expenses to be reimbursed ie. Taxi fares and missed hotel accommodation in Madrid. Called Qatar’s customer help line. On hold for 40 minutes then hung up on. Twice. I’ve tried emailing too. Nope. No reply."
3,3/10,"Absolutely appalling customer care and refusal to compensate!! Qatar Airways used to be a great airline with exemplary standards and customer service, my last few experiences have not reflected this. The latest debacle involved the airline cancelling our flight only 9 days before departure. When trying to claim compensation as is my ‘guaranteed’ right by law under EU Regulation EC 261/2004, the customer care officer, Nabeel simply refused. I am needless to say never going to use this airline again and taking them to the Civil Aviation Authority to acquire my compensation!"
4,1/10,"This is my first time booking with Qatar Airways & it will be my last. I have yet to board my flight but have already endured multiple frustrations. Less than a month before my flight I logged onto my booking to reserve my seat. However, to my surprise there was a notice saying my flight had been changed – to a different day. I understand that times can change however I did not receive one email or notification that my flight had been switched. If I hadn’t randomly checked my booking I would’ve missed my flight entirely. I have emailed customer service multiple times regarding this saying that I will not be in the departure city on the new departure day and will need alternative options. All I received was an apology and a statement telling me to contact my local customer support. I have called my local branch five times of which I have been put on hold for over 20 mins each time.  I have sent more emails to customer service and still waiting on a reply. It has gotten to the point where I am leaving in 2 weeks and had to adjust all my other plans resulting in high costs. Qatar Airways is terrible in terms of communication with their customers."
