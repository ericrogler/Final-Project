Ordered Vegetarian for my daughter for return flights as she does not eat meat. On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and told her go and complain about it!!! So I there called the office and let them know of their staff’s rudeness and that on a 15 hour long haul flight she was starving!! They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room. Yes the meal this time was correct, the staff though were the same rude people, must be a trait for AA. But her seat was broken, Yes Broken, they offered her no where else to move told her once again go complain, she ended up laying on the floor in front of the ext row to try and sleep on the once again 15 hour long haul flight back, so to you AA I would never in my wildest dreams if it was even FREE fly your out of touch airline or ever recommend you to anyone.

There is little attention paid to staff and it shows in the indifferent, verging on rude service delivered by by cabin crew and customer service personnel. They just don’t seem to care. They have invested in new aircraft, they needed to as their fleet is still old. However, even newer aircraft breakdown as this one did. You can’t criticise them for this, it happens to the best of carriers. However, how these issues are handled is an important measure of customer service.

The agent was a little rude because i was not happy that now I would have to go at 3am instead of 7am. She actually said “do you mean to tell me you don’t want to get up early?? It also meant i had to change reservations for hotels because of the timing so I was not thrilled.. The first leg to dallas was ok. Then it connected to Japan Air. I can’t say enough good things about them. Such a nice, accommodating staff. So clean and pleasant, great attitudes..best flying experience I ever had. In the bathroom there was a hand written note saying thank you for flying with them and to ask if we needed anything. There was always moist towelettes and toothbrushes available, and mouthwash too.The return was all American Airlines. I asked an attendant for help putting my carryon up and she said Oh No way..

But wow American Airlines how bad a service commitment could you show, the plane was actually very modern but the seats were truly terrible- very narrow no where near wide enough for your average person to sit in comfortably, rock hard cushions with almost no leg room and a non-removable armrest set so low that it stuck painfully into my hip for the whole trip. Half way home due to this very poor seating my legs had gone numb and I was suffering a terrible hip pains, I requested help from a hostess who’s answer amazed me when she stated “Its economy deal with it !!” Sadly she was not the only staff member who seemed to think rudeness was an acceptable practice, on our flight there was quite a large number of people from a religious group, it was so obvious that one hostess did not like these poor people and constantly treated them rudely and was very intolerant towards their children. I thought of American Airlines as a flag carrier but can only describe its staff showing as no pride in this at all, they were scruffy with untied hair and a poor dress code quality. One male staff member with his crumpled shirt constantly hanging out and his underarm sweating very obvious- when a fellow passenger suggested he tidy himself up he just aggressively stated “ I’m working here” Overall I can only describe this as the worst flight I’ve ever been on, it left both myself and my wife feeling very disappointed and myself still recovering from a very painful hip 2 days later.

On my flight to Saint Kitts for study, ai experienced sever weather conditions that lead to a delay in my arrival at my destination.

First, I understand that weather cannot be avoided and is not the fault of the airline. It is not their fault that they were unable to land at my airport due to the weather conditions or that We flew around in the air for over two hours then stopping for gas at another airport until we finally reached my destination. It’s not their fault that I missed my connecting flight due to the delay. However, it is unreasonable to ask me to pay for a hotel because it is not their policy to compensate for weather related conditions. After spending $1690 on a flight I was forced to spend an additional 210 on a hotel room and arrive late at my destination. When taking my compliant to customer service, I was given a generic answer in which they misspelled my name. I know that 200 bucks isn’t a lot of money for most people. Howeve, I am a student on a budget and ever single dollar is accounted for as well is ever single hour of my time is planned. Not only did they disregard my financial constraints but also my time. I didn’t complain that I had to wait an additional day to get to my destination. I made arrangements with my school to have the issue resolved.

That chance was undeserved. They disappointed me yet again. I used points to buy a first class flight to splurge while on vacation. I chose a specific 6:30 to 11 am flight since I was meeting my family in Tampa and we were renting a car together. I received no communication about the flight and decided to call in at 4:30 am to check in. It was at that time that I found out my flight had been cancelled and rescheduled to 10:30 am. Apparently the flight crew needed rest. I called into reservations and was told that my convenient morning flight has been changed to a 10:30 to 8:30 pm flight. The worst part is that the agent made it seem like they were doing me a favor. I told her the new flight didn’t work. I was then downgraded to regular class on an earlier flight with no option of getting refunded. I asked the woman on the phone to double check there was no first class seats available on the 6 am flight.

487,"October 2, 2015",10/10,Flew Economy,Went to Vegas For a long weekend (first vacation in 2 Years) and ended up spending over 20 hours in the airport or on the plane!!!

It took us three planes and 16 hours to fly our 3 hours to Chicago! The first plane left the gates to find that there were engine problems. The pilot called in and was not able to take off because this issue had already been reported two weeks  pryer on the same plane!

we wait 4 hours for another plane and it pulls away from the gates only to return with the same engine trouble as the first plane!!!

Very old and worn out planes and interior. 99% of the cabin crew were very old and arrogant and I am not sure how they will assist passengers incase of an emergency because they are very old and they weren’t very happy to see any of the passengers. It was clearly shown by their facial expressions, body language, attitude and tone of voice. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile with me or any other passenger including the passengers who were flying with me. Terrible terrible terrible! Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. Wearing their own ties, colourful hats (for christmas), badly ironed clothes, uncombed hair. They looked like a bunch of homeless people wearing their own clothes which they collected from bins. There was no UNIFORM! Every single one of them were wearing different things. I am Shocked and disgusted by the behaviour and appearance of the cabin crew! The ground staff are equally bad. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. Since none of the passengers were informed or given a reason for the delay few passengers started to ask the cabin crew what was going on. Few minutes later the purser or the CSD who made the announcement (more like barked at the passengers) on the PA to inform the passengers what was going on sounded like “Just suck it up, shut up and wait.
